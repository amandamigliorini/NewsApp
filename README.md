# Overview

This is my first mobile application using React. It is a news app and it is using the Data.io API to fetch the news. Here some description about the application:

   ✔️The app has a landing/welcome page and there is a button that opens the home screen.
   ✔️On the Home Screen we have a search bar and button, a carrousel with breaking news and a news trending list.
   ✔️The menu shows the Home, Discover and Bookmarks Screens.
   ✔️The Discover Screen allows the user to search using a search bar and choosing between categories and countries.
   The bookmarks screen shows the bookmarked news. It is using Async Storage.

My purpose was learn about mobile development and meet some requirements. Here is some of the requirements I fulfilled:
   ✔️Have at least one screen
   ✔️Be interactive with the user (e.g. responds to inputs by displaying appropriate outputs)
   ✔️Incorporate two or more screens
